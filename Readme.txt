PREFACE

Enables KeePass to encrypt databases using the Serpent algorithm.

CREDITS

Many thanks to Dominik Reichl for creating KeePass Password Safe, without which,
this plugin would not exist. Thanks also goes to DotNetCrypt team for C#
implementation of cryptography algorithms not included in the .NET framework
(in this plugin I only use the Serpent implementation).
